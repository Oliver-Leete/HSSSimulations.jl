```

## Parameters

```@docs
Types.AbstractProblemParams
```

## Load Sets

These are not actually memebers of the [`Boundary`](@ref) module, but they are
an integral part of how the boundary conditions are set up for a simulation so
they are included here instead of in the [`Solver`](@ref) documentation.

```@docs
Types.AbstractLoadSet
Solver.loadSetSolver!
Solver.loadSetSolver!(::FixedLoadSet,::AbstractResult,::Int,::Problem{T,Gh,Mp,R,OR,B}) where { T<:Any,Gh<:Any,Mp<:Any,R<:Any,OR<:Any,B<:Any}
Solver.loadSetSolver!(::LayerLoadSet,::AbstractResult,::Int,::Problem{T,Gh,Mp,R,OR,B}) where { T<:Any,Gh<:Any,Mp<:Any,R<:Any,OR<:Any,B<:Any}
