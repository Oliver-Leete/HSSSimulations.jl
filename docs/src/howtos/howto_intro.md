# Recipes Introduction

Unlike the tutorials provided, these recipes are not step-by-step directions,
but instead they are chunks of code that can be used to do a thing. These can
either be used directly if the thing they do is what you want to do, or they can
be used as inspiration to do something similar to what the recipe does.
