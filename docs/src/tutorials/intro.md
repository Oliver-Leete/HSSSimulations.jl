# Tutorial Introduction

## How to start

There are different ways to use the tutorials:

  - **[Recommended]** Reading the html version of the tutorials. This is the
    recommended way if you want rapid access to the material with no setup steps.
    Simply click in one of the links below.
  - **[Recommended]** Running the Jupyter notebooks locally. A working
    installation of Julia in the system is required.
  - Running the notebook remotely via [binder](https://mybinder.org).
    In that case, go to the desired tutorial and click the icon
    ![binder icon](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg). No local installation of Julia needed.
  - Reading a non-interactive version of the notebook
    via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). In that
    case, go to the desired tutorial and click the icon
