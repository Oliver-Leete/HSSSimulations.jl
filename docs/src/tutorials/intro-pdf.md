# Tutorial Introduction

## How to start

There are different ways to use the tutorials:

  - Reading the pdf version of the tutorials. This is the recommended way if you
    want rapid access to the material with no setup steps. Simply click in one of
    the links below.
  - Running the Jupyter notebooks locally. A working
    installation of Julia in the system is required.

There are two additional ways to view the tutorials that are only available when
viewing the web version of the documentation.
